    "#### SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "Customer churn poses a major threat to SyriaTel,a telcom Service Provider, leading to revenue loss and increased marketing expenses. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of churning, allowing SyriaTel to act before they leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing customer usage behavior, billing patterns, and service history, we can develop a churn prediction system that empowers the business to launch targeted retention effortsâ€”such as personalized offers or proactive service follow-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Challenge: SyriaTel wants to reduce churn by identifying customers likely to cancel their service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Approach: Build a binary classification model using customer activity, billing data, and service interactions to predict churn risk. The output will guide SyriaTel in taking data-driven actions to retain customers and minimize revenue loss."
